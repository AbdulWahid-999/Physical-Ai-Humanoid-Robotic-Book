# PROMPT

instead of Ai Assistant use Chat and add the smooth transition on the button as well change the color of the button to 21af90 this

# RESPONSE

I have changed the text of the button to "Chat" and its background color to `#21af90`. The button already has a smooth transition defined in its CSS.
