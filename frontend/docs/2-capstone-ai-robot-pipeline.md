# Capstone: Simple AI-Robot Pipeline

This capstone chapter integrates the knowledge gained throughout the textbook to build a simple, end-to-end AI-robot pipeline. We will combine concepts from ROS 2, simulation, and vision-language-action systems to create a functional example.

## Project Overview

- Define a simple robotic task (e.g., object detection and grasping).
- Outline the pipeline stages: perception, decision-making, action.

## Implementation Steps

- **ROS 2 Integration**: Setting up nodes for sensor data and motor control.
- **Vision System**: Using a camera in simulation for object detection (e.g., YOLO).
- **Language Interface**: Simple command parsing for task initiation.
- **Action Execution**: Planning and executing robot movements in Gazebo or Isaac Sim.

## Evaluation

- Testing the pipeline's robustness and performance.
- Discussing future extensions and improvements.

This chapter provides a practical demonstration of physical AI concepts, allowing readers to apply their understanding in a hands-on project.
