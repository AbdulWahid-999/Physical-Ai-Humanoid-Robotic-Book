# ROS 2 Fundamentals

Robot Operating System (ROS) is a flexible framework for writing robot software. ROS 2 is the latest iteration, designed for improved real-time performance, security, and multi-robot systems. This chapter introduces the core concepts and tools of ROS 2.

## ROS 2 Concepts

- **Nodes**: Executable processes that perform computations.
- **Topics**: Buses over which nodes exchange messages.
- **Services**: Request/reply mechanisms for direct communication.
- **Actions**: Long-running, goal-oriented tasks with feedback.
- **Parameters**: Dynamic configuration values.

## ROS 2 Tools

- `ros2 run`: To execute a node.
- `ros2 topic`: For interacting with topics.
- `ros2 service`: For interacting with services.
- `ros2 param`: For managing parameters.
- `rviz2`: A 3D visualization tool.
- `rqt`: A suite of GUI tools.

This chapter will provide practical examples and guidance on setting up a basic ROS 2 environment and interacting with its components.
